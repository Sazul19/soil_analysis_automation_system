## **Project Summary: Soil Color Identification Using CNN**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to identify soil types based on color using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The final application is designed to assist in soil health assessment by leveraging smartphone-captured images and mapping them to the Munsell color chart for actionable insights.

### **Key Features**
1. **Soil Color Detection**:
   - Identifies soil colors from images and maps them to the Munsell color chart.
2. **Real-World Compatibility**:
   - Designed for images captured via smartphones under varying lighting and environmental conditions.
3. **Model Architecture**:
   - Utilizes CNNs (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet) trained on soil image datasets for robust and scalable performance.
4. **Scalability**:
   - Modular design allows for easy fine-tuning with additional soil data.

### **Challenges Encountered**
- Variability in soil image quality due to lighting and texture.
- Overlap in soil color classes (e.g., similar shades of brown and gray).
- Dataset imbalance impacting model generalization.

### **Current Status**
- Initial CNN model trained, achieving 60% test accuracy.
- Model underperforming due to dataset limitations and environmental variability.
- Plans to enhance accuracy with better dataset preprocessing, advanced architectures, and color-specific normalization techniques.

### **Next Steps**
1. Dataset improvements: Balance classes, normalize lighting, and increase diversity.
2. Experimentation with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet) for transfer learning.
3. Implementation of additional features, such as moisture normalization and color segmentation.
