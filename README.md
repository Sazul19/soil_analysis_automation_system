## **Project Summary: Soil Color Identification Using CNN**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to identify soil types based on color using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The final application is designed to assist in soil health assessment by leveraging smartphone-captured images and mapping them to the Munsell color chart for actionable insights.

### **Key Features**
1. **Soil Color Detection**:
   - Identifies soil colors from images and maps them to the Munsell color chart.
2. **Real-World Compatibility**:
   - Designed for images captured via smartphones under varying lighting and environmental conditions.
3. **Model Architecture**:
   - Utilizes CNNstrained on soil image datasets for robust and scalable performance.
4. **Scalability**:
   - Modular design allows for easy fine-tuning with additional soil data.

### **Challenges Encountered**
- Variability in soil image quality due to lighting and texture.
- Overlap in soil color classes (e.g., similar shades of brown and gray).
- Dataset imbalance impacting model generalization.

### **Current Status**
-Experimenting with efficienB to enhnace texture  identification
-Dataset is still under preprocessing
